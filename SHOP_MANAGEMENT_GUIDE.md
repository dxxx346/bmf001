## üõ†Ô∏è Frontend Integration

### React Hooks

The system provides custom React hooks for easy frontend integration:

```typescript
import { useShops, useShopAnalytics, useShopSales, useWithdrawals } from '@/hooks/useShops';

// Shop management
const { shops, loading, createShop, updateShop } = useShops();

// Analytics
const { analytics, fetchAnalytics } = useShopAnalytics(shopId);

// Sales data
const { sales, fetchSales } = useShopSales(shopId);

// Withdrawals
const { requests, createWithdrawal } = useWithdrawals(shopId);
```

### Example Usage

```typescript
// Create a new shop
const handleCreateShop = async () => {
  const result = await createShop({
    name: "My Store",
    description: "Digital products store",
    settings: {
      theme: "light",
      currency: "USD"
    }
  });
  
  if (result.success) {
    console.log("Shop created successfully!");
  } else {
    console.error("Error:", result.error);
  }
};

// Fetch analytics
const handleFetchAnalytics = async () => {
  await fetchAnalytics('30d');
  console.log(analytics);
};

// Create withdrawal
const handleWithdraw = async () => {
  const result = await createWithdrawal(1000, 'bank_transfer', {
    bank_name: 'Chase Bank',
    account_number: '1234567890',
    routing_number: '021000021'
  });
  
  if (result.success) {
    console.log("Withdrawal request created!");
  }
};
```

supabase db push
```

### Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in your environment:

```env
# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key

# Redis (for caching)
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=your_redis_password
```

### Testing
