## Recovery Procedures

### 1. Incident Detection & Classification

#### Automatic Detection
- **Health Checks**: Every 30 seconds
- **Alerts**: Slack + PagerDuty + Email
- **Escalation**: Automatic after 5 minutes

#### Manual Detection
- **User Reports**: Customer support tickets
- **Monitoring Dashboards**: Sentry, Cloudflare Analytics
- **Third-party Status Pages**: Vercel, Supabase, AWS

#### Classification Levels
- **P1 (Critical)**: Complete service outage, data loss, security breach
- **P2 (High)**: Partial service outage, performance degradation
- **P3 (Medium)**: Non-critical feature outage
- **P4 (Low)**: Minor issues, cosmetic problems

### 2. Initial Response (0-15 minutes)

#### Immediate Actions
1. **Assess Impact**: Determine scope and severity
2. **Activate DRP**: Notify incident commander
3. **Assemble Team**: Page on-call engineers
4. **Communicate**: Post status page update
5. **Document**: Start incident log

#### Decision Matrix
```
IF database is down AND backups are accessible:
  → Proceed to Database Recovery (Section 3)

IF entire region is down:
  → Proceed to Regional Failover (Section 4)

IF security breach suspected:
  → Proceed to Security Incident Response (Section 5)

IF data corruption detected:
  → Proceed to Data Recovery (Section 6)
```

### 3. Database Recovery

#### Scenario: Database Corruption/Failure

**Step 1: Assessment (5 minutes)**
```bash
# Check Supabase status
curl -s https://status.supabase.com/api/v2/status.json

# Test database connectivity
npm run db:status

# Check backup availability
node scripts/backup.js list --type=database
```

**Step 2: Identify Recovery Point (10 minutes)**
```bash
# List recent backups
node scripts/backup.js list --type=database

# Select most recent clean backup
# Estimate data loss (time since backup)
```

**Step 3: Database Restoration (30-60 minutes)**
```bash
# 1. Stop application traffic (maintenance mode)
export MAINTENANCE_MODE=true

# 2. Create new database instance (if needed)
# Via Supabase dashboard or CLI

# 3. Restore from backup
node scripts/backup.js restore --path="s3://bmf001-backups/prod/database/db-backup-2025-01-01T12-00-00.sql.gz" --type=database

# 4. Verify data integrity
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed:verify

# 5. Test application functionality
npm run test:integration

# 6. Resume traffic
export MAINTENANCE_MODE=false
```

**Step 4: Validation (15 minutes)**
- Test user authentication
- Test payment processing
- Test file uploads/downloads
- Verify critical user journeys

### 4. Regional Failover

#### Scenario: Primary Region (us-east-1) Outage

**Step 1: Immediate Response (5 minutes)**
```bash
# Activate disaster recovery environment
# This switches to backup region automatically for most services

# Update DNS to point to DR region (if needed)
# Most services (Vercel, Cloudflare) handle this automatically
```

**Step 2: Database Failover (15 minutes)**
```bash
# Promote Supabase standby in eu-west-1
# Via Supabase dashboard

# Update environment variables
export NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="https://dr-project.supabase.co"
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."

# Deploy updated configuration
vercel --prod
```

**Step 3: Cache Failover (10 minutes)**
```bash
# Switch to standby Redis instance
export REDIS_HOST="dr-redis-host.com"
export REDIS_PORT="6379"

# Warm cache with essential data
npm run cache:warm
```

**Step 4: Validation (20 minutes)**
- Full system testing
- Performance validation
- User acceptance testing

### 5. Security Incident Response

#### Scenario: Data Breach or Security Compromise

**Step 1: Containment (Immediate)**
```bash
# 1. Isolate affected systems
# 2. Preserve evidence
# 3. Reset all credentials
# 4. Enable additional logging
```

**Step 2: Assessment (30 minutes)**
- Determine scope of breach
- Identify compromised data
- Assess impact on users
- Document timeline

**Step 3: Recovery (Variable)**
- Patch vulnerabilities
- Restore from clean backups
- Reset user passwords
- Issue new API keys

**Step 4: Notification (24 hours)**
- Notify affected users
- Report to authorities (if required)
- Update security measures
- Public communication

### 6. Data Recovery

#### Scenario: Accidental Data Deletion

**Step 1: Stop Further Changes (Immediate)**
```bash
# Enable read-only mode
export READ_ONLY_MODE=true

# Prevent automatic cleanup jobs
export DISABLE_CLEANUP=true
```

**Step 2: Assess Scope (15 minutes)**
```sql
-- Identify affected data
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM affected_table WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL;

-- Estimate recovery requirements
SELECT MIN(deleted_at), MAX(deleted_at) FROM affected_table WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL;
```

**Step 3: Recovery Options**
```bash
# Option A: Point-in-time recovery (if recent)
node scripts/backup.js restore --path="backup-before-deletion" --type=database

# Option B: Selective data recovery
# Extract specific tables/records from backup
# Merge with current data

# Option C: Rollback specific transactions (if possible)
# Use database transaction logs
```
