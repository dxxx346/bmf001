# Review and Rating System - Complete Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive review and rating system implementation for the digital marketplace. The system includes verified purchase reviews, advanced moderation, ML-based fake review detection, seller responses, incentive programs, and sophisticated rating aggregation algorithms.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Verified Purchase Reviews Only ✅
- **Purchase Verification**: Reviews can only be submitted by users who have actually purchased the product
- **Purchase Linking**: Each review is linked to a specific purchase record
- **Verification Badge**: Verified purchase reviews display a special badge
- **Enhanced Trust**: Verification status is prominently displayed and factored into rating calculations

### 2. Advanced Rating Aggregation Algorithm ✅
- **Weighted Scoring**: Implements a sophisticated weighted average that considers:
  - Verification status (1.5x multiplier for verified purchases)
  - Helpfulness votes (0.5x to 2.0x multiplier based on helpful/unhelpful ratio)
  - Review recency (newer reviews get slight boost, max 30% depreciation over 1 year)
  - Review quality indicators
- **Real-time Updates**: Product ratings are automatically recalculated when reviews are added/modified
- **Database Function**: Uses PostgreSQL function `calculate_weighted_rating()` for efficient computation

### 3. Review Moderation Queue System ✅
- **Multi-tier Queue**: Priority-based queue system (1-5 priority levels)
- **Auto-flagging**: ML system automatically flags suspicious reviews
- **Manual Reporting**: Users can report reviews with specific reasons
- **Moderator Assignment**: Auto-assignment based on workload balancing
- **Bulk Operations**: Support for bulk moderation actions
- **Performance Tracking**: Tracks moderator performance and resolution times

### 4. Helpful/Unhelpful Voting System ✅
- **Vote Types**: Helpful, Unhelpful, Spam, Fake vote categories
- **Vote Tracking**: Real-time vote count updates with triggers
- **Abuse Prevention**: Users cannot vote on their own reviews
- **Vote Changes**: Users can change their vote type
- **Helpfulness Metrics**: Displays helpfulness ratios for reviews with sufficient votes

### 5. Seller Response System ✅
- **Verified Responses**: Only product owners can respond to reviews
- **Public/Private**: Sellers can choose response visibility
- **Edit Tracking**: Response edit history and counts
- **Response Rate**: Tracks seller responsiveness metrics
- **Notification System**: Notifies users when sellers respond

### 6. Review Incentive Program ✅
- **Multiple Incentive Types**: Points, discounts, cashback, badges
- **Flexible Criteria**: Minimum rating, word count, verification requirements
- **Usage Limits**: Control maximum uses per incentive
- **Expiry Management**: Time-limited incentives
- **Auto-processing**: Automatic incentive claim processing
- **Analytics**: Comprehensive incentive performance tracking

### 7. Fake Review Detection using ML ✅
- **Multi-factor Analysis**: 
  - Text analysis (sentiment, readability, spam indicators)
  - User behavior patterns (review frequency, timing)
  - Product context (price range, category risk)
- **Real-time Scoring**: Reviews are analyzed immediately upon submission
- **Confidence Levels**: ML confidence scores for moderation prioritization
- **Feature Extraction**: Comprehensive feature set for accurate detection
- **Feedback Loop**: System to improve ML models based on moderation outcomes
